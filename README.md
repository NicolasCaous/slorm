# Slorm

Slorm is a library consisting of a collection of classes and functions created to assist [slonik](https://github.com/gajus/slonik) users in creating and managing tables. Its name is the concatenation of "slonik" with "ORM".

It is heavily influenced by a python ORM named [peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee).

## Is slorm an ORM?

No. But, it can be used to create one. In fact, I (the creator of this project) am a supporter of the idea that each project should have its own ORM, created especialy for the database requirements of each project. This is the true intent of slorm: a set of tools created for the pourpose of building an ORM with no constraints besides the postgres database.
